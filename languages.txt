What is your favorite programming language? Why?

Answer - Python is my favorite programming language.

I did not start programming with Python but I felt more comfortable coding with Python.

I believe that there are fewer syntatical errors that I make with python and that is 
something I like because you are not blocked or hindered by these minor errors and can focus on the business logic.

It is easy to learn as well.
